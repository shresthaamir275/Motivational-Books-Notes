Think and Grow Rich - Nepoleon Hill

1.  “Set your mind on a definite goal and observe how quickly the world stands aside to let you pass.”
2.  “The way of success is the way of continuous pursuit of knowledge.”
3.  “A quitter never wins-and-a winner never quits.”
4.  “Every adversity, every failure, every heartbreak, carries with it the seed of an equal or greater benefit.”
5.  “More gold had been mined from the mind of men than the earth it self”
6.  “To win the big stakes in this changed world, 
    you must catch the spirit of the great pioneers of the past, 
    whose dreams have given to civilization all that it has of value, 
    the spirit that serves as the life-blood of our own country – your opportunity and mine, to develop and market our talents.”
7.  
“We refuse to believe that which we don’t understand.”
